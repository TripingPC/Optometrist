# Optometrist

Optometrist is a Windows app that allows you to change various aspects of how the Oculus app/drivers behave.

## Current planned features:
- Disabling the main window of OculusClient.exe to reduce CPU/RAM usage and speed up boot times.
- Changing the cold, medium and hot colors of the guardian.
- ~Turning off Dash and Guradian entirely while leaving SteamVR working.~

This project doesn't currently intend on being a replacement for OculusTrayTool, but may become one in the future.
